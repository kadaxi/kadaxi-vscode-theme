# Kadaxi vscode theme.
Personally I think default vscode theme it's too pretty, but something that doesn't add up at all it's the dark palette around the editor (sidebar, status bar colors, etc), then it came to me that maybe I could merge material and default theme, making few changes and adding languages support, hope you enjoy it, happy coding.
